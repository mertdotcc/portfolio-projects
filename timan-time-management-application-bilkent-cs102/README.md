# TiMan - Time Management Assistance Software
In this course project, we as a group of 5 designed an application that keeps track of a user's daily activities and creates some insightful charts from the stored data. The aim of the application was to help the user to get an overview of their day and make more data-driven decisions to optimize their time efficiency. The TiMan application is written in Java and designed to run on devices with Windows operating systems only.
