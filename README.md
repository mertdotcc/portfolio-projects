# Portfolio Projects

Repository containing portfolio of projects that I have completed for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
    - [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/mertovski1/portfolio-projects/tree/master/finding-donors-for-charityml): Testing out and training several supervised learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs) and AdaBoost to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000a year, and to identify likely donors for a non-profit organisation.<br>
    __Skills__: Python, Scikit-learn, Decision Trees, AdaBoost, SVMs, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- ### Course Projects - Bilkent University
    - [TiMan - Time Management Application Software](https://github.com/mertovski1/portfolio-projects/tree/master/timan-time-management-application-bilkent-cs102): We as a group of 5 designed an application that keeps track of a user's daily activities and creates some insightful charts from the stored data. The aim of the application was to help the user to get an overview of their day and make more data-driven decisions to optimize their time efficiency. The TiMan application is written in Java and designed to run on devices with Windows operating systems only.<br>
    __Skills__: Java, Java-Swing, Object-oriented programming, GUI design

    - [Dry & Happy - An Optimization Problem](https://github.com/mertovski1/portfolio-projects/tree/master/modeling-and-optimization-bilkent-ie202): We as a group of 2 built the modeling scheme of a fictitious diaper company, Dry & Happy, in an attempt to minimize the production cost of the company while satisfying all the customer needs and production restraints.<br>
    __Skills__: FICO Xpress, Mathematical modeling, Linear programming, Simplex algorithm,  Duality and sensitivity analysis, Network models
