# Portfolio Projects

Repository containing portfolio of projects that I have completed for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
    - [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/mertovski1/portfolio-projects/tree/master/finding-donors-for-charityml): Testing out and training several supervised learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs) and AdaBoost to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000a year, and to identify likely donors for a non-profit organisation.<br>
    __Skills__: Python, Scikit-learn, Decision Trees, AdaBoost, SVMs, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
    
    - [Image Classifier on a Flower Dataset](https://github.com/mertovski1/portfolio-projects/tree/master/flower-image-classification): Testing out several pre-trained deep learning models for image classification from [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html) such as `AlexNet`, `VGG-19`, `ResNet-18` and `Densenet-121` to create a flower species classifier using the [102 Category Flower Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) from the [Visual Geometry Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) of the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). Then, creating a command line application that can be used to classify any flower images with more than 91% accuracy. <br>
    __Skills__: Python, PyTorch, Image Classification, Numpy, GPU programming
    
    - [Identifying Customer Segments with Arvato Analytics](https://github.com/mertovski1/portfolio-projects/tree/master/identifying-customer-segments): Applying several unsupervised learning techniques and algorithms to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The dataset for this project has been provided by [Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics](https://www.bertelsmann.com/), and represents a real-life data science task.
    __Skills__: Python, Scikit-learn, Principal Component Analysis, K-Means Clustering, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- ### Course Projects - Bilkent University
    - [TiMan - Time Management Application Software](https://github.com/mertovski1/portfolio-projects/tree/master/timan-time-management-application-bilkent-cs102): We as a group of 5 designed an application that keeps track of a user's daily activities and creates some insightful charts from the stored data. The aim of the application was to help the user to get an overview of their day and make more data-driven decisions to optimize their time efficiency. The TiMan application is written in Java and designed to run on devices with Windows operating systems only.<br>
    __Skills__: Java, Java-Swing, Object-oriented programming, GUI design

    - [Dry & Happy - An Optimization Problem](https://github.com/mertovski1/portfolio-projects/tree/master/modeling-and-optimization-bilkent-ie202): We as a group of 2 built the modeling scheme of a fictitious diaper company, Dry & Happy, in an attempt to minimize the production cost of the company while satisfying all the customer needs and production restraints.<br>
    __Skills__: FICO Xpress, Mathematical modeling, Linear programming, Simplex algorithm,  Duality and sensitivity analysis, Network models
